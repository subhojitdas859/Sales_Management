- The data was taken from the Microsoft sample data and was extracted using SQL server into csv files to use them in the Power BI dashboard.
- Date_table was used to retrieve dates about the performances of the sales through time
- Sales_table, product_table and customer_table show information about sales, products and customers in that order
